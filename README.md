## About the project
This is a full-stack project created by a team of four students who took part in DCI's Web Developer course. 

## The Team

## The idea
Nowadays many tattoo artists rely on social media for finding work. Social media is ruled by algorythms that are often hard to understand. Tattoers are required to play by the algorythms' rules, which can make or break their work. You can be the most talented, friendliest artist out there, but if you don't manage your social media account properly, you can potentially get little to no work.

We believe this needs to stop. 

Our aim in this, on the first hand, project is to create a place for tattoo artists, where they can focus on building their portfolio. On the second hand, we also want for tattoo seekers to have an easier time finding artists based on their needs, such as style, location and price.
