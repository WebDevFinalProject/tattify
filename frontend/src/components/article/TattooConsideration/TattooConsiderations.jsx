          Thinking of getting inked? A tattoo is a lifelong work of art and a
          powerful form of self-expression. But before diving in, make sure you
          have all the details to make your tattoo journey a memorable and
          positive experience.

        <div className="highlight-box">
          <h3>‚ú® Quick Tip:</h3>
          <p>
            Trust your instincts. If something feels off about a studio or
            artist, don't hesitate to explore other options!
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2>1. üé® Choose the Right Design</h2>
        <p>
          Your tattoo is a reflection of your personality. Spend time exploring
          different designs, tattoo styles, and their meanings. Whether it's a
          symbolic quote, a vibrant piece of art, or a simple minimalist design,
          ensure it resonates with you again.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Browse tattoo portfolios on Instagram or Pinterest for inspiration.
          </li>
          <li>
            Discuss your ideas with your tattoo artist for a personalized touch.
          </li>
          <li>
            Think long-term: Will this design hold meaning years from now?
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. üè¢ Research the Studio and Artist</h2>
        <p>
          A clean, professional studio and an experienced artist are key to a
          safe tattoo experience. Check reviews, visit the studio, and ask
          questions.

          "A good tattoo isn't cheap, and a cheap tattoo isn't good."
        </blockquote>

        <h2>3. üìç Consider the Placement</h2>
        <p>
          Tattoos hurt more on certain body parts like ribs, feet, or hands.
          Additionally, consider how visible you want your tattoo to be. Will it
          align with your lifestyle or profession?
        </p>
        <div className="placement-guide">
          <h3>üí° Placement Sensitivity Chart:</h3>
          <p>High Pain: Ribs, feet, hands</p>
          <p>Moderate Pain: Arms, thighs, back</p>
          <p>Low Pain: Shoulders, calves</p>
        </div>

        <h2>4. üï∞Ô∏è Understand the Commitment</h2>
        <p>
          Tattoos are a lifelong decision. While removal options exist, they can
          be costly and painful. Be 100% sure before committing.
        </p>

        <h2>5. üíß Prepare for Aftercare</h2>
        <p>
          Aftercare is essential for keeping your tattoo vibrant and
          infection-free. Follow these steps:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Wash your tattoo gently with antibacterial soap.</li>
          <li>Apply a thin layer of fragrance-free moisturizer.</li>
          <li>Avoid direct sunlight and swimming until fully healed.</li>
        </ul>
